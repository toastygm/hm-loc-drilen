# HârnWorld Location Module: Drilen Manor

Drilen Manor is a "Location Module" for the Foundry VTT system. This location module
is designed to depict the Drilen Manor in the Fethael Hundred of the Kingdom of Kaldor, on
the island of Hârn in the [HârnWorld](https://columbiagames.com/harnworld/) fantasy
setting; however, this manor could be adapted to exist anywhere in any fantasy setting.

Although designed for use with the [HârnMaster](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/hm3)
system, this module is mostly system-agnostic.  Detailed descriptions of the actors
has been provided in journal entries to facilitate conversion to other game systems.

Drilen is a small but wealthy manor located between the Chyle forest and the Omin river
in Fethael Hundred.  Sir Eadwin Lurnay holds Drilen Manor from the Baron of Getha.
