{"_id":"3vKbqmfbWVqTqpxu","name":"Settlement Information","content":"<p><strong>LOCATION:</strong> Fethael Hundred, Kaldor<br /><strong>STATUS:</strong> Manor<br /><strong>GOVERNMENT:</strong> Sir Eadwin Lournay<br /><strong>LIEGE:</strong> Baron of Getha<br /><strong>POPULATION:</strong> Village 115; Manor 21</p>\n<p>Drilen is a small but wealthy manor, at least by the standards of Fethael Hundred. The manor house stands to the north of the village near the fork in the road, with the creek on one side and the common on the other. Aside from the tower, the Peonian chapel is the only other stone structure on the manor.</p>\n<h2>Government</h2>\n<p>Sir Eadwin Lournay holds Drilen Manor from the Baron of Getha. The Lournays have been vassals of the Indamas for many generations and have held Drilen for centuries. Sir Eadwin has been the lord of Drilen and its vassal manors for 24 years. Before he assumed the manor, he had roamed Harn as a member of the Royal High Guard under Torastra and Miginath. His wealth of experience makes him a wise counsel to many in the Shire.</p>\n<p>Sir Eadwin is one of the Baron’s confidants and, because of this; Sir Harapa Indama (q.v., Bidow) treats him with more deference and respect than might be expected between an heir and his father’s vassal. Sir Harapa is especially attentive to Sir Eadwin’s thoughts on governing, preferring to nurture and empower the lower classes rather than direct their actions.</p>\n<p>Sir Harapa’s brother, Sir Haradoc Indama is the Hundred’s Bailiff and he derides Sir Eadwin for the same reasons Harapa respects the old man. Conversations between the old knight and the young Bailiff of the Hundred are cordial but brief. Sir Eadwin knows of Sir Haradoc’s ambitions and has reservations about Haradoc’s harsh tactics.</p>\n<p>Sir Eadwin is a kind and generous lord, often remitting fees to help a needy tenant make ends meet. The peasants view him as a benevolent lord who keeps their best interests close to his heart. His Hall Moot has the same atmosphere as a village picnic. Since few criminal cases are ever heard in Drilen most of the business during the moot involves marriages or births.</p>\n<h2>Economics</h2>\n<p>Drilen’s 1,410 acres lie in the fertile valley (LQ 1.11) between the Chyle Forest and the Omin River. Farms export flax products like cordage, thread, and linseed oil to Getha. Surplus flax seed is used in inks and paints or is pressed into cakes for trail rations for pack animals.</p>\n<p>The inhabitants have no shortage of meat for sale or personal consumption. Swine, goats, and cattle are the most common livestock. Venison and wild boar are plentiful in the forests south of the manor for the nobles and Sir Eadwin encourages rabbit snaring amongst his peasants.</p>\n<p>Drilen manor is widely known for a type of soft, white cheese called ylina. Farmers make this creamy delicacy from the milk of their cattle and sell small wheels (1/4 lb.) encased in willow boxes. The cheese travels well but should be eaten within 3 – 4 months or it will harden to an inedible mass.</p>\n<p>Hard woods from the nearby forests are used for a wide variety of locally produced commercial products. Oak, pine, and chestnut board timber is exported for use throughout eastern Kaldor. Smaller markets are found providing materials to furniture and cabinet makers.</p>\n<p>Furs from the mountains in the Chyle Forest are also exported. Bear fur, which is thick and heavy, is sold for bedding and rugs. Wolf and fox fur are sold for use in clothing. Sable pelts, found in the higher elevations, are sought after for the wealthier customers while rabbit and squirrel adorn the wardrobe of the middle classes.</p>\n<h2>Religion</h2>\n<p>The religious climate of Drilen is similar to the rest of Kaldor. Worship of Agrik, Morgath, or Naveh is a capital offence. Other religions are tolerated but not encouraged. Services for Larani are held in the chapel at Hakstyn. Peonian rites are held in the village temple. Most villagers worship Peoni but the craftsmen and their families travel to Getha for Halean services.</p>\n<h2>Current Events</h2>\n<p>The mill was recently burned by Tordai, the miller’s son. The boy raped a girl from Denwald and his family refused to pay the fine, meaning that Tordai was due to be flogged by her family. Instead, the lad escaped from the manor’s dog kennel [B] (the makeshift jail cell). Seeking revenge on his family for abandoning him to the law, Tordai set fire to his family’s business before escaping into the forest only three days ago.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7oAV921OwDC9ZOFU":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":400000},"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.umJT3JbRRwJEdNOI"},"cf":{"id":null,"path":"Drilen","color":"#000000"}}}

Sir Eadwin Lournay and some of his retainers (or maybe his brother, the special bailiff from Hundholt) are going into the Chyle Forest after the bandits. The group meets them on the road or in the village. Sir Eadwin calls on the PCs to accompany him. His woodsmen have tracked the bandits to a camp several miles into the hilly forests. His plan is to either assault the camp, have the PCs sneak into camp and capture the leader of the bandits, or masquerade as bandits and join the bandit group. Sir Eadwin offers to split the 500d bounty with them. The bandit leader is wanted dead or alive.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If the PCs refuse, Sir Eadwin will call them cowards but not hinder them. They will later learn that Sir Eadwin and his companion are being held captive for ransom – which could be used to revisit this encounter.</li>\n<li>If the PCs agree to an assault, Sir Eadwin will lead the assault. The party must overcome a group of about 10 bandits (see <em>Bandits of Chyle</em> for the composition of the bandit group.) While lightly armed and poorly fed, the bandits are crafty and skilled at arms.</li>\n<li>If the PCs try to sneak into camp, they will have a hard time sneaking past the guards, who are relaxed but not stupid.</li>\n<li>If the PCs attempt to hire on to the gang, they will have to convince the bandits they are really interested (prosperous looking PCs will not be believed). Sooner or later, they will get the chance to get alone with their prey.</li>\n<li>If the PCs manage to get the brigand or his head, Sir Eadwin will escort them to Getha to collect their reward. Sir Eadwin will split the reward as promised.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>A Disturbing Letter</h2>\n<p><em>[ Inspired by Harn Encounter 9 in 101 Harn Encounters by Aaron Kavli, Lythia.com. ]</em></p>\n<p>The PCs happen upon a grievously wounded knight east of Drilen. He is sprawled against a tree, bleeding from several wounds. His horse lies dead nearby, impaled by two spears. The corpses of four, conspicuously unidentified, soldiers litter the small clearing. Although mortally wounded, the knight has made his attackers pay dearly.</p>\n<p>The knight weakly motions to the PCs. He paws at a pouch on his belt and charges them to deliver a letter of the gravest sensitivity to the Baron of Getha. He finishes with, \"Deliver it or she will die. Fail and I shall collect from beyond, I swear my soul to it!” The exertion causes the knight to lapse into unconsciousness and he succumbs to his wounds several minutes later.</p>\n<p>In the pouch is a letter from Lady Erila Kobarney (q.v., Hyzevel), to the Bailiff of the Hundred, Sir Haradoc Indama (q.v., Hundholt). In the letter, the lady pleads to be released from their affair and threatens to do herself some unspecified harm in her despair. Alternatively, the letter has plans for Lady Erila to run away from Hyzevel to join Sir Haradoc permanently, at the GM's discretion.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If the PCs do not deliver the message, they will hear about the Lady following through on the course of action she described in the letter.</li>\n<li>If the PCs take the letter to Sir Haradoc, he will arrange a meeting east of Hundholt. At the meeting, the PCs will be given a 1000d promissory note for their silence. Sir Haradoc’s warders will then ambush them. If the PCs manage to escape, they will find that the note is worthless, bearing the name of a fictitious usurer and an obviously forged seal.</li>\n<li>\n<p>If the PCs make their way to Getha keep and demand an audience with the Baron, they will have to wait at least a week before meeting the Baron or the Constable, though they will not know how long it will actually take.</p>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\n<li>A page in the Baron’s livery summons them to an audience in the Baron’s Hall [Getha Keep, 2-1]. If the PCs follow the page, the garrison will ambush them (Sir Chimin will not be there). Assuming the PCs survive, they will be incarcerated in the basement of the keep. The Baron will get the note and announce his intention to try the PCs for sedition.</li>\n<li>While the PCs languish in the cells, they hear word of the knight's death. The keep buzzes with the news and the baron is unavailable for some time. Upon his return, the PCs are released without apology. The Constable remarks that it is best they leave the Shire, if not the kingdom.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>If the PCs speak of the letter discreetly to Sir Eadwin, they will be granted an audience with the Baron. If the PCs can convince the baron they had nothing to do with his knight’s death (easily done by presenting the note), he will give his thanks and a reward of 50d each. Later, the PCs hear rumors of the Baron visiting Hundholt and Sir Haradoc’s sudden (and surprising) devotion to the Laranian Rites of Contrition in the Keep’s Chapel.</li>\n<li>If the PCs approach the Sir Tommas Kobarney with the letter, he will arrange a meeting west of Hyzevel and ambush them. Survivors will hear of raids on Hundholt soon after. They should realize that the Kobarneys will hunt them, as they know Lady Erila’s shameful secret.</li>\n</ol>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7oAV921OwDC9ZOFU":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":1200000},"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.4q24jrc6Ed41L6Rm"},"cf":{"id":null,"path":"Drilen","color":"#000000"}}}

{"name":"[4] Yeoman Tireal the Harper","content":"<p>Late last winter, a man arrived in the village with two followers. He said that his name was Tireal and introduced his companions as Eäs, his cook, and Syriam, his bodyguard. After a brief interview with Sir Eadwin, he was granted a house and some land, leasing the fields to Koron Oralis [17] to farm while he whiles away his time practicing with a lute. He tells people that he is a wandering harper, searching for inspiration in the quiet village. Few believe him because Tireal can’t sing, Eäs is a large, powerful man, and Syriam is a petite woman. No one has had the courage to question his story, however, since Syriam attends militia drill and is competent with a bow.</p>\n<p>In truth, Tireal is the proverbial prodigal son. He chose to take his inheritance (his father is the bailiff of Gratima in Navintas Hundred) and see the world. After living hard and fast in Tashal, Burzyn, and Thay for a few years, Tireal exhausted his funds but was unwilling to return home to his disapproving parents. He wrote to his favorite aunt Tommasina and she invited him to live in Drilen.</p>\n<p>Lady Tommasina is actually his great aunt on his father’s side (the lord of Sycound is her grandson and Tireal’s uncle) but she felt that she should honor her family bond with the young wastrel. On her instructions, he gathered up his few goods and came to Drilen. Lady Tommasina arranged for Tireal to be granted a yeoman’s fee for a modest consideration and the lad became the local eccentric in the small community. He is still a bit of a wastrel and a rake but, since Drilen is small and out of the way, there is little trouble for him to get into.</p>\n<p>As far as the other villagers are concerned, Tireal’s companions are as enigmatic as their master. Eäs is actually a Savoryan Mavari (apprentice Shek P’var,) hiding from his master after a misunderstanding. Syriam was a barmaid in Thay that found young Tireal face down in a gutter and took pity on him. He invited her to live with him in Drilen, but she agreed only on the condition that she wouldn’t have to cook. Hence Eäs pretends to be the cook and Syriam plays Tireal’s protector. Tireal hopes to hire a real cook soon as Eäs can only make burnt porridge. He has approached Calan Gwynten [5] with the job offer.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"7oAV921OwDC9ZOFU":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":800000},"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.BaZZU5RMwPA0ADKt"},"cf":{"id":"temp_f377ja282zd","path":"Drilen#/CF_SEP/The Village","color":"#000000"}},"_id":"hWV5x0nLsW8Bai2j"}
