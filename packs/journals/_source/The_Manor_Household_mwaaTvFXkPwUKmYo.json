        "content": "<p>Sir Eadwin is a 65 year old, grandfatherly knight of the realm. He is the lord of Drilen and clan head of the Lournay. He has worked for his entire life to increase the land and the prestige for his family. They have served the Indama clan as knights and soldiers for generations and Sir Eadwin feels that the best path is to continue to do so.</p>\n<p>Sir Eadwin was born in 655 to the junior branch of the Lournay clan. Eadwin squired at Getha before receiving a position in the Royal High Guard. As a young man, Sir Eadwin rode in King Torastra’s bloody wars and later guarded King Miginath’s royal progress. He was raising a family in Tashal when Fate intervened.</p>\n<p>While Sir Eadwin served the King, his cousin Aelmere was lost while hunting in the Chyle Forest. Aelmere was the Lournay heir and bailiff of Emerule. Eadwin was recalled from royal service and became lord of Drilen upon the clanhead’s death</p>\n<p>Eadwin’s first act was to appoint his brother Marby as bailiff of Emerule. Eadwin has been a good lord. His son and heir Worgan administers the manor while Sir Eadwin looks out for the family's interests in Getha, Hundholt, and Tashal. He is embarrassed by the banditry of a fellow noble but is more humiliated by his inability to bring the bandits to justice. The appearance of Gladyk Onaret and his band of outlaws (q.v., Getha Keep 3-2 and Emerule Settlement Overview, Current Events) has given him the excuse to request assistance from the Baron without completely admitting his shortcomings.</p>\n<p>Sir Eadwin is of medium height and build. Since his lack of size impaired his performance as a jouster, he devoted his energies and great skill to becoming a consummate diplomat, warrior, and hunter. He wishes that Gladyk had asked him for guidance before turning to outlawry, but now he would deliver the bandit chief to his liege, the Baron, in shackles for the ultimate punishment.</p>",
